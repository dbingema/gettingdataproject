# "Getting Data" Course Project

This repo contains five files:

* this README.md file
* the R script "run_analysis.R"
* the results of running the script: "projectResult.txt"
* the file "feature_names.txt" which lists the names of the variables in the result
* the code book "codeBook.md" describing the variable names



## Usage

The R-script should be placed in the directory directly above the UCI dataset 
folder named "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset" which is generated by unzipping
the downloaded "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip" file before running the
script..

The script will step into the correct data folders to load all files required to
complete the exercise. The result of the script is a new text file
"projectResult.txt" in the folder the script is located in.
